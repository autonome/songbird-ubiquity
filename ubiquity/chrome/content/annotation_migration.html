  <title>Ubiquity Command Feed Migration</title>

<h2 class="top">Ubiquity Command Feed Migration</h2>
<p>As of Ubiquity 0.1.3, we have changed the way that command feed
subscriptions are tracked.  This was done to significantly improve
Ubiquity's performance and also allow command subscriptions to be kept
when browser history is cleared (see
bug <a href="http://labs.toolness.com/trac/ticket/146">#146</a> for
more information).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one side effect of this is that most of the command
feeds you were subscribed to prior to this change are no longer
being subscribed to.</p>
<p>Prior to Ubiquity 0.1.3, you were subscribed to the following
   command feeds:</p>
<ul id="command-feeds">
</ul>
<p>If there's any listed above, you can visit each of them and
resubscribe to any that you'd still like to have.</p>
