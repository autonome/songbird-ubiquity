EXPORTED_SYMBOLS = ['SafeBox'];

// This object provides a safe interface to communicate with a
// Components.utils.Sandbox running untrusted code using either
// xpcshell or running within a XULRunner application (such as Firefox
// or Thunderbird).  All data going into and out of the sandbox is
// marshalled using JSON, and all communication happens synchronously.
//
// The SafeBox is created by passing it a sandbox instance and a
// function to evaluate code in a sandbox.  The sandbox instance
// should be safe to use--i.e., no untrusted code should have yet been
// executed in it.
//
// Once called, untrusted code can be executed in the sandbox that
// should define a public function called receiveFromOutside().  The
// function takes a JS object and can do whatever it wants with it.
//
// Sending an object into the sandbox can be done by calling the
// SafeBox.sendInside() method.  If untrusted code in the sandbox wants to
// send a safe object out of the sandbox, it can call the sendOutside()
// global function; at this point, any responders attached to the
// SafeBox instance via SafeBox.addResponder() are notified via a call
// to their receiveFromInside() function, which is passed the 'safe'
// version of the object as its only parameter.
